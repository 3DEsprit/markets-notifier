The Extension uses existing login sessions, so all you need to do is go to the Blender Market site, and login to the account you want to monitor.

You can click the extension icon to get a list of the unread messages, and the details of each one.

## Options

![Options](markets-filters.png)

The filters options allows you to limit notifications to prodect names you provide as a comma-separated list of partial project names. For this to work, refrain from using spaces,
and filter with a distinguing portion of the project name. 

Example:

__Project Name__: Super Special Project

To match the project name, any of the following filters will work:

_Super, Spec, Special, Project_

When filtering mutliple projects, you will only need to filter the portion of the name
that is unique.
